                  <p>Please note: these announcements reflect those presented to you prior to the commencement of an AMC MCQ examination. Please read the announcements written below.</p>
               </div>
               <p style='margin-top: 2em'>The MCQ Trial Examination has a total of 50 questions.</p>
               <ol class='instructions'>
                  <li>Please treat this MCQ Trial Examination as an actual AMC MCQ examination, including compliance to the examination rules and regulations.</li>
                  <li>Please remove your mobile phone, books, notes, etc. Allow yourself a blank piece of paper and a pen.</li>
                  <li>The time limit for this examination is 83 minutes. You must pace your time using the clock on the computer – the clock and timer (top right corner of your screen) commence when the examination is activated.</li>
                  <li>Use your blank paper, if required, during the examination.</li>
                  <li>The MCQ Trial Examination consists of 50 Type A questions.</li>
                  <li>Each question or incomplete statement is followed by five suggested answers, or completions, labelled A, B, C, D and E.</li>
                  <li>Only one answer out of the five suggested answers, or completions, is correct.</li>
                  <li>Read each question thoroughly and decide which one answer is the BEST choice.</li>
                  <li>You will use the mouse to click on the “NEXT” button (bottom right corner of the screen) when your examination is activated. This will confirm your answer and move you to the next question.</li>
                  <li>In order to move to the next question, you MUST select an answer.</li>
                  <li>You will use the mouse to click on the button next to the response of your choice.</li>
                  <li>If the question is too long to fit on the screen, you have to scroll down by using the arrows that will automatically appear on the right of the screen. Each question only occupies one screen.</li>
                  <li>Marks will not be deducted for incorrect answers.</li>
                  <li>When you have answered the last question of the examination, and you have time remaining on your session timer, you can review any question and change any answer. The computer will automatically take you to the review screen.</li>
                  <li>If you click on this button you cannot return to the examination questions and the examination is completed. This button can be clicked at any time during the review (if applicable) and once this is done the examination is finished. If the session time limit has been reached before you complete all questions in the examination [or you are in the reviewing phase] the following text will automatically appear “SESSION TIME HAS EXPIRED”.</li>
